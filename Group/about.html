                                 <h2>History of Hot Chocolate</h2>
                                    <p>Believe it or not, hot chocolate was not originally served sweet according to historical records.  Yes, Mayans were drinking ground up cocoa seeds and water with <strong>chili peppers</strong> as early as 500 B.C.  This spicy chocolate beverage evolved into something sweet more recently in 1500 A.D. when explorer Cortez brought cocoa seeds and the chocolate drink-making tools back to Spain.  Shortly 200 years later, Hans Sloane from Jamaica introduced the idea of adding milk to this beverage.  The rest is history and chocolate is now often enjoyed even as a solid form.
